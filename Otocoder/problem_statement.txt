Problem Statement

One-time pad (patented by Vernam in 1919) is one of the most widely known schemes to encrypt a binary string to achieve confidentiality. This scheme takes a binary string (a string consisting of only the digits 0 and 1) as input and outputs another binary string of the same length. The input is called the plaintext, and the output is called the ciphertext. The scheme uses a key which is another binary string of the same length as the input. The i-th bit of the ciphertext is defined as the XOR of the i-th bit of the plaintext and the key (see the notes for XOR definition). The ciphertext is sent to the receiving party.In this problem, we will consider several messages, each of length N, encrypted using a single key of length N.We would like to investigate how strong this cipher is. Suppose an adversary manages to find out the content of all the original messages (i.e., the plaintexts) and some of the encrypted messages (i.e., ciphertexts). These messages are given in the String[]splaintextsandciphertexts, respectively. Return the number of possible keys that are consistent with this data. The constraints will guarantee that there is at least one such key. A key is consistent if for all members ofciphertextsC, there exists a member ofplaintextsP such that when P is encrypted using the specified key, it becomes C.  

Definition

Class:  NetworkXOneTimePad  

Method:  crack  

Parameters:  String[], String[]  

Returns:  int  

Method signature:  int crack(String[] plaintexts, String[] ciphertexts)  

(be sure your method is public)  

Notes

-  XOR is a binary operation on bits defined as follows: 0 XOR 0 = 0, 0 XOR 1 = 1, 1 XOR 0 = 1, 1 XOR 1 = 0.  

Constraints

-  plaintextswill contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.  

-  Each element ofplaintextswill contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.  

-  All the elements ofplaintextswill contain the same number of characters.  

-  All the characters inplaintextswill be either '0' (zero) or '1' (one).  

-  All the elements ofplaintextswill be distinct.  

-  ciphertextswill contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.  

-  All the elements ofciphertextswill contain the same number of characters as all the elements ofplaintexts.  

-  All the characters inciphertextswill be either '0' (zero) or '1' (one).  

-  All the elements ofciphertextswill be distinct.  

-  There will exist at least one key that is consistent with the givenplaintextsandciphertexts.  

Examples

0)  

{"110",
 "001"}

{"101", "010"}

Returns: 2

The two possible keys are "011" and "100".  

1)  

{"00", "01", "10", "11"}

{"00", "01", "10", "11"}

Returns: 4

2)  

{"01", "10"}

{"00"}

Returns: 2

3)  

{"000", "111", "010", "101", "110", "001"}

{"011", "100"}

Returns: 6
